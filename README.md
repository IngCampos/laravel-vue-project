# Laravel Vue Intranet

_Intranet system to automate processes, show information, manage users and permissions._

### Project goal by martin-stepwolf :goal_net:

Personal project to show the skills I developed in my internship by building a similar project and improve it with other courses and better practices. 

### Achievements :star2:

As web developer, I knew already about PHP vanilla, Vue, databases, etc.
The challenge was create a professional project, where I achieved.

- Create databases, default and fake data with migrations, seeders and factories.
- Learn about MVC pattern and better practices.
- Create dynamic pages with Vue (JavaScript) using Axios as HTTP client.
- Manage the security, views, routes, model, controllers, etc as Laravel works.
- Use third party packages like vue-json-csv, vue-sweetalert2 and vue2-datepicker.

Then I take some courses and I improve the project with:

- Fix an admin template, where styles and some html elements are defined.
- Optimize some views by getting the data in the view(not by HTTP client).
- Backend validation in the request (app/Http/Request).
- Dynamic views with slug in the url.
- Cleaning and optimizing the code.
- Implement docker and docker compose for a better environment.

## Getting Started :rocket:

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites :clipboard:

The programs you need are:

-   [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started).
-   [Docker compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/).

### Installing üîß

First duplicate the file .env.example as .env.

```
cp .env.example .env
```

Then create the docker image.

```
docker-compose build app
```

Run the image created. 

```
docker-compose up -d
```

Then install the PHP packages.

```
docker-compose exec app composer install
```

Generate the application key.

```
docker-compose exec app php artisan key:generate
```

Then create the symbolic link (from public/storage to storage/app/public).

```
docker-compose exec app php artisan storage:link
```

Then install the JavaScript packages with npm.

```
docker-compose exec app npm install
```

Finally generate the database with fake data:

```
docker-compose exec app php artisan migrate --seed
```

## Running the project :computer:

First generate the public files with

```
docker-compose exec app npm run dev
```

Note: Each time SASS and JavaScript files are updated you need to run the past command, to make it automated run:

```
docker-compose exec app npm run watch
```

Note: `php artisan serve` is not neccessary due to nginx server.

## Deployment üì¶

For deployproduction environment you need extra configurations for optimization and security as:

Generate optimized JavaScript files.

```
docker-compose exec app npm run production
```

Set in the file .env the next configuration.

```
APP_ENV=production
```
